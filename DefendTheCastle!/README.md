Defend The Castle is a solo game where you're playing as an archer,
your main goal is to shoot swarming enemies to defend the castle, the game gets harder with each round!  

## Defend The Castle!
This was a solo project that I've created which means I am the only contributor. I will mention a couple of things that made a great challenge and maybe what i'm proud of, myself first time working with UE5.  

### Landscape & Foliage 
The thing I started with, beginning my project.

Creating the different materials used on the landscape like Rocks(mountains)/Grass/Dirt/etc.  

With UE nodes/blueprints creating the functionality for each ground material, where should grass appear and where the rocks should appear.  

Sculpting the landscape was done by hand(which took a while).  

Creating a navmeshbound where within the foliage is going to spawn.  

Making the logic for cooperation between landscape and foliage, in order for the foliage to spawn in correct areas, ex. trees on grass, bushes on grass, the rocks to appear on rock landscape material, etc.
