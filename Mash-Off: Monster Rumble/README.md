# Contribution
## Physics
I've worked on the player movement and its rotation.  

Implemented jumping for the player.  

Adjusted the gravity in order to work as desired.  

Worked with debugging/testing.  

## Weapons
Adjusted each weapon physics in order for it to work as desired when dropped.  

Created the functionality for throwing the weapon and the weapon throwing mid-jump.  

Created all weapon projectiles and how they interact with the surroundings and other players.  

Made the weapon holding point for each weapon so it doesn't look weird while holding it.  

The explosion physics and functionality.  

Created the unusual behaviour for the rocket that's launched by the rocket launcher.
